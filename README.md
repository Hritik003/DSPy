# DsPy

DSPy is a `super exciting` new framework for developing` LLM programs`! 

Pioneered by frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, we can build much more powerful systems by chaining together LLM calls! This means that the output of one call to an LLM is the input to the next, and so on. We can think of chains as programs, with each LLM call analogous to a function that takes text as input and produces text as output. Provides a general purpose modules which replaces with string-based prompting and also, helps in automating the Language Models.
## Programming, **NOT** Prompting

It is an LLM Programming language.
- Clean up your prompts and structured input/outputs
- Control how your LLM modules interact with each other programatically.
- Streamline the process of prompting with an input and objective.
- Create Modules of LMs that can work to achieve objective.
- Then train the modules using Datasets built by hand, and by using LLMs.
- Evaluate the modules with the Metrics that is custom coded in `DSPy`
- Including FineTuning smaller models like BerT, T5.
